FW History See CmdMessenger/SSB.txt

FW 1.9:	add IGNORE_GC_PREPARE  and the command from PC: ignoreGCPrepare   NOT RUNNING. USE 1.8

FW 1.8:  fakes GC_Prepare !


FW 1.7:
started 13.11.15
released 17.11.

FW 1.4.
	- add	Hardware Simulation for using naked Arduino
			Can also be used WITH existing Hardware.
			
			FAKE_TEMPERATURE_AND_HEATERS with fake Temperature up and down  for Hardware Simulation
			No PWM will be send out
			Temperature will go up and down according to the goalTemperature
			Trap_COOL will never be sent out		

	- add	FAKE_SYNC_SIGNALS
			will run a 5 seconds delay instead of waiting for the signal (gc-prepare and gc-start)

	- add	SINGLE_RUN  false=Run cycle at startup, true=do not run cycle, but use Standby Temperature

	- need flags: Incubation Time, IsInSequence, IsInSingleRun


FW 1.3:		
started 4.11.2015
released 12.11.  Eichler

	- add Cryo Timeout Ignore 
	- change Timer1  to a global Timer that counts Milliseconds  (no more use of millis()...)

	fixed Bugs:
	001	PWM: duty_cycle from 0-255  chg. to 200-2000 Millis_Bang
	002	 was type cast problem




3.11.2015	FW 1.1	
	002		Start_Timer,  Wait_Timer  not ok...
	001		PWM too fast: killing Power Supply
